Project Description
=====================


We found that Rbpj knockout can convert Muller glia into retinal neurons in adult mice, and this effect is enhanced by Oct4 overexpression. Interestingly, Oct4 overexpression alone in wildtype Muller glia can also convert a small number of Muller into neurons.
We want to investigate how Oct4 mediates the process.
The purpose of this experiment is to find Oct4 binding sites in wild type  Muller glia after Oct4 overexpression , and if the binding sites are different/more in the Rbpj Knockout Muller glia.
